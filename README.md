# Demo
- This repository will include demos of neuron pruning on 3D-UNets for 3D semantic segmentation as well as MobileNetV2 and I3D for video classification.

# Notes
-  We will upload our code very soon, before the 3DV 2020 conference. Please do not download the current repository for the code completement.
